Team WonderWoman Project Proposal
Title: Task Manager
Project Description:

Every student needs to arrange their files in an organized manner to ensure easy access to their documents. Managing multiple files can be a challenging task, especially considering that each student is typically juggling various subjects, each with its own set of major and minor requirements. In addition, students often have personal files stored on their computers, further adding to the complexity of file management.

Recognizing the difficulties that students face in keeping their files in order, our group has undertaken the initiative to create a comprehensive and user-friendly task management system. This system is specifically designed to assist students in categorizing their files based on priority levels, due dates, categories, descriptions, and more. By implementing this system, students will be able to effortlessly organize their academic and personal documents, thereby enhancing their overall productivity and ensuring that they can quickly locate the materials they need when the time comes.

Key-Features:
